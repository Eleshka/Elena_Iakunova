Most likely, instead of good perfumes, we will get an air freshener with a sharp pungent smell.\\n': 1, 'In this regard, there are a number of organizational issues that I consider necessary to voice:\\n': 1, '1) Fragrance supplier ? Fragrance system supplier. Our cars belong to the luxury class, and smells for cars should be developed by professionals who do not just understand what luxury is, but live in this environment themselves. It is necessary to strictly separate these 2 areas of work, they will be connected only by the technical requirements for a bottle of liquid.\\n': 1, '2) The very idea of using gel has not been tested. We checked how the fluid works and how the cartridges work. The liquid is building us up, moreover, a more global idea is tied to the liquid, not tied to the car, which is now in the implementation process, because we have agreed on this with you.\\n': 1, '3) Is it still possible to request / buy samples of the proposed system with gel from the supplier in order to test the quality and functionality and remove a number of issues?\\n': 1, 'Colleagues, if at this stage we have a misunderstanding, I suggest we meet and discuss everything in detail once again. Otherwise, we risk getting a system / odors that are completely inconsistent in their essence with the class of the car.\\n': 1}\n"
